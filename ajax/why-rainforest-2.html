	The world needs a new model of Rainforest conservation led by indigenous tradition. No conservation effort in the tropics has been more successful than that of the Kayapo Indians of Brazil. They&#180;ve achieved more for the preservation of tropical forest than any other group or organizations on earth. They are the true guardians of the rainforest.
