<h4>Territorial Monitoring &#38; Control</h4>
<p>Government authorities are largely absent as far as enforcing protected areas including indigenous territories in the Amazon. The NGO partnership with the Kayapo provides the Kayapo organizations with transportation (boats, motors, trucks, fuel, equipment maintenance, overflight surveillance)  and communications (short wave radios) they need to patrol their borders. In the works is GIS satellite imagery and technology for remote monitoring.</p>

<h4>Sustainable Small Enterprise Development</h4>
<p>After 50 years of increasing contact, the Kayapo have come to depend on certain manufactured goods from outside society such as metal tools, guns, motors, fuel, glass beads and clothes. Loggers and goldminers take advantage of this need by pressuring Kayapo to allow illegal access to timber and gold on their lands in exchange for cash. The Kayapo decided they wanted no involvement with illegal predatory activities. NGO partnerships are helping the Kayapo establish their own sustainable enterprises.  By developing their own small businesses that fit with their culture and natural environment, the Kayapo are maintaining their independence.</p>

<h4>Institution Building</h4>
<p>The creation of Kayapo NGOs that function in national society has bridged the gap between the Kayapo and the outside. Their organizations give the Kayapo: a voice in Brazilian society (whereas without them, they would have no voice); the administration skills needed to access outside support; the means to bring together and unite leaders from far-flung communities so that they can devise a united strategy to meet the serious challenges faced by all Kayapo.</p>
