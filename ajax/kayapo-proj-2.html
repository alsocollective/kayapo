		<h4>Territorial Monitoring &#38; Control</h4>
		<p>Government authorities are largely absent as far as enforcing protected areas including indigenous territories in the Amazon. The NGO Alliance with the Kayapo provides the Kayapo organizations with transportation (boats, motors, trucks, fuel, equipment maintenance, overflight surveillance) and communications (short wave radios) they need to patrol their borders. The alliance is also trying to provide GIS satellite imagery and technology for remote monitoring.</p>

	<h4>Sustainable Small Enterprise Development</h4>
	<p>after 50 years of increasing contact, the Kayapo have come to depend on certain manufactured goods from outside society such as metal tools, guns, motors, fuel, glass beads and clothes. Loggers and goldminers often try to take advantage of this need by pressuring Kayapo individuals to allow illegal access to timber and gold on their lands in exchange for cash. The Kayapo jointly decided they wanted no involvement with illegal predatory activities but instead they wanted to learn how to make their own money to buy the things they need themselves. Therefore, the NGO alliance helps the Kayapo to establish their own small enterprises based on non-timber forest products that can be harvested sustainably and sold by all members of a community who choose to (eg, brazil nut, cumaru seed, jamborandi leaves, field courses for international students, handicrafts). Developing their own small businesses that fit with their culture and natural environment, the Kayapo maintain their independence.</p>

	<h4>Institution Building</h4>
	<p>The creation of (NGOs) that function in national society and can bridge the gap between the Kayapo and the outside. Their organizations give the Kayapo; a voice in Brazilian society whereas without their organizations, they would have no voice; ii) the administration necessary to access outside support; the means to bring together and unite leaderships from far-flung communities so that they may devise strategy to meet the very serious challenges faced by all Kayapo.</p>
