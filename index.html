		<p>The Kayapo have only been in contact with outside society since the 1960s. They continue to defend their traditional territories but are still learning how to negotiate the new realities of the outside capitalist monetary society that surrounds them. When the development frontier reaches indigenous people in full force as it has with the Kayapo, tribes who lack outside support to help them understand and deal with outside society are vulnerable to invasion by loggers, ranchers and miners and eventually, loss of their land.</p>

			<p>Government authorities are largely absent as far as enforcing protected areas including indigenous territories in the Amazon. The NGO Alliance with the Kayapo provides the Kayapo organizations with transportation (boats, motors, trucks, fuel, equipment maintenance, overflight surveillance) and communications (short wave radios) they need to patrol their borders. The alliance is also trying to provide GIS satellite imagery and technology for remote monitoring.</p>

		<h4>Sustainable Small Enterprise Development</h4>
		<p>after 50 years of increasing contact, the Kayapo have come to depend on certain manufactured goods from outside society such as metal tools, guns, motors, fuel, glass beads and clothes. Loggers and goldminers often try to take advantage of this need by pressuring Kayapo individuals to allow illegal access to timber and gold on their lands in exchange for cash. The Kayapo jointly decided they wanted no involvement with illegal predatory activities but instead they wanted to learn how to make their own money to buy the things they need themselves. Therefore, the NGO alliance helps the Kayapo to establish their own small enterprises based on non-timber forest products that can be harvested sustainably and sold by all members of a community who choose to (eg, brazil nut, cumaru seed, jamborandi leaves, field courses for international students, handicrafts). Developing their own small businesses that fit with their culture and natural environment, the Kayapo maintain their independence.</p>
